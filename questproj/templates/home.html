    <h2>{{ SITE_NAME }} and The Nostradamus Project</h2>
<br/>
    <p>
        <b>{{ SITE_NAME }}</b> is a curated archive of {{ clue_source_name }}, selected to cover a wide variety of subject matter
        and provide specific insights intoa user's profile of interests. (It's a big bunch of questions you can answer.)
    <p>
<br/>
    <p>
        The <b>Nostradamus Project</b> collects data from visitor {{ clue_source_name }} answers. Then, using a sophisticated
        collection of projection algorithms, a controled hypothesis engine is constructed from which prognostical hypotheses can be generated.
        (Fortunes, more accurate as you answer more clues.)
